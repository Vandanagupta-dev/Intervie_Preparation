# ✅ **ASP.NET vs ASP.NET MVC (Interview Answer for 2 Years Experience)**

### **1. Architecture**

* **ASP.NET Web Forms:**

  * Event-driven, WebForms architecture.
  * Uses **Page Life Cycle**, ViewState, PostBack.
  * Looks similar to Windows Forms development.

* **ASP.NET MVC:**

  * **Model–View–Controller** architecture.
  * Clean separation of concerns, no ViewState/PostBack.
  * More control over HTML and request pipeline.

---

### **2. ViewState**

* **WebForms:** Heavy **ViewState** increases page size and slows performance.
* **MVC:** No ViewState → **lighter, faster, more SEO-friendly**.

---

### **3. Control Over HTML & UI**

* **WebForms:**

  * Auto-generated HTML via server controls.
  * Less control over HTML/CSS/JS.

* **MVC:**

  * Full control over HTML.
  * Better suited for responsive UI, Bootstrap, jQuery, Angular, React.

---

### **4. Testability**

* **WebForms:** Hard to unit test; tightly coupled UI & logic.
* **MVC:** Excellent for unit testing; controllers are loosely coupled.

---

### **5. Performance**

* **WebForms:**

  * Slower because of ViewState and server control overhead.
* **MVC:**

  * Faster due to lightweight pipeline and clean separation.

---

### **6. URL Routing**

* **WebForms:** Limited routing support.
* **MVC:** Built-in flexible routing → SEO-friendly URLs.

---

### **7. Developer Control**

* **WebForms:**

  * Rapid development with drag-and-drop controls.
  * Suitable for small internal apps.

* **MVC:**

  * Full developer control, lightweight, modern web development.
  * Ideal for large scalable applications.

---

# 🎯 **Short Conclusion (Interview Ready)**

> **ASP.NET WebForms** follows a page life cycle with ViewState and server controls, making development faster but heavier and less testable.
>
> **ASP.NET MVC** provides a clean separation of concerns, no ViewState, full control over HTML, faster performance, better SEO, and is highly testable — which is why most modern web apps prefer MVC.

📌 2. Trigger
Definition:

A trigger is a special stored procedure that executes automatically when INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE happens on a table.

Key Points:

Auto-fired — cannot be called manually.

Used for auditing, logging, data validation.

Works with Inserted and Deleted pseudo-tables.

Cannot accept parameters.

Should be lightweight to avoid performance issues.

When to Use:

Audit logs (who inserted/updated data)

Auto-calculation (e.g., update stock after sale)

Enforcing rules that application should not bypass

📌 3. Function
Definition:

A function returns a single value or a table, and must return something.

Key Points:

Must return value (scalar or table).

No side effects → cannot perform INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on tables (except inline table-valued functions).

Can be used in SELECT statements.

No transaction control (cannot use COMMIT/ROLLBACK).

More lightweight than stored procedures.

Types:

Scalar Function → returns one value

Inline Table-Valued Function

Multi-Statement Table-Valued Function

When to Use:

Calculations (Age, Tax, Total, Discount)

Reusable expressions inside SELECT

Return table for joins
--------------------------------
await keyword asynchronous task ko non-blocking tarike me chalata hai.
Ye method ko pause karta hai, thread free kar deta hai, aur task complete hone par wapas resume karta hai.

Here is the **best interview-level explanation** of **Transaction in SQL**, suitable for *2 years experience*.

---

# ✅ **What is a Transaction in SQL?**

A **transaction** is a group of SQL statements that are executed as a **single unit of work**.

👉 If all statements succeed → **COMMIT**
👉 If any statement fails → **ROLLBACK**

This ensures **data consistency, accuracy, and integrity**.

---

# 🔥 **ACID Properties (Very Important for Interview)**

A good transaction must follow **ACID**:

### **1. Atomicity**

* All statements run as one unit
* Either **complete fully** or **rollback fully**

### **2. Consistency**

* Data must remain **valid** before and after the transaction

### **3. Isolation**

* Each transaction runs **independently**
* No other transaction should interfere

### **4. Durability**

* Once committed → changes are **permanent** even if system crashes

---

# 🧾 **Basic Syntax of SQL Transaction**

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- SQL statements
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 1000 WHERE AccountID = 1;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 1000 WHERE AccountID = 2;

COMMIT;   -- If everything is OK
-- ROLLBACK;  -- If any error occurs
```

---

# 📌 **Example: Money Transfer Scenario**

### Step 1: Deduct amount

### Step 2: Add amount to another account

If any step fails → rollback

```sql
BEGIN TRAN;

UPDATE Account SET Balance = Balance - 5000 WHERE AccNo = 101;
UPDATE Account SET Balance = Balance + 5000 WHERE AccNo = 102;

IF @@ERROR <> 0
    ROLLBACK;
ELSE
    COMMIT;
```

---

# ⭐ **Interview-Ready Explanation (Short Answer)**

> A transaction in SQL is a group of one or more SQL statements executed as a single logical unit to ensure data consistency.
> SQL transactions follow ACID properties and use **BEGIN TRAN**, **COMMIT**, and **ROLLBACK** to manage changes.

---

# 🔹 **Commands Related to Transactions**

| Command                     | Purpose                     |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **BEGIN TRAN / START TRAN** | Start a transaction         |
| **COMMIT**                  | Save all changes            |
| **ROLLBACK**                | Undo all changes            |
| **SAVEPOINT**               | Create rollback checkpoints |

# ✅ 1. IEnumerable vs IQueryable

**Answer:**

“IEnumerable and IQueryable both are used for data fetching but the main difference is execution.

IEnumerable works on in-memory data, meaning data is first fetched from the database and then filtering is done in application memory.

IQueryable works on database level, meaning filtering is done at the database side before fetching data, so it is more efficient for large data.

In short, IEnumerable → in-memory processing
IQueryable → database-level processing.”

---

# ✅ 2. API Flow (when endpoint hit)

**Answer:**

“When a client hits an API endpoint, the request first goes to the routing system which matches the URL to a specific controller and action method.

Then the controller receives the request, processes the business logic (or calls service layer), and interacts with the database if needed.

After processing, the response is returned in JSON format back to the client.

So the flow is: Client → Route → Controller → Service/Business Logic → Database → Response (JSON).”

---

# ✅ 3. Entity Framework Tracking

**Answer:**

“Tracking in Entity Framework means that the context keeps track of changes made to entities.

When tracking is enabled, any changes in objects are automatically detected and saved to the database using SaveChanges().

If we don’t need tracking (for read-only data), we use AsNoTracking(), which improves performance.”

---

# ✅ 4. Website Slow ho jaye to kya karoge

**Answer:**

“If a website is slow, first I will identify the root cause.

I will check:

* Network/API response time
* SQL queries performance
* Use of indexes in database
* Backend logic optimization

I will also use debugging tools and logs to analyze performance.

If needed, I will optimize queries, reduce unnecessary API calls, and improve code efficiency.”

---

# ✅ 5. Project Explanation (BEST ANSWER)

**Answer:**

“Currently, I am working on a web-based application built using ASP.NET MVC / .NET Core, Web API, and SQL Server.

In this project, I am responsible for developing backend APIs, implementing business logic, and handling database operations using Entity Framework.

The application includes features like user management, data processing, and reporting.

I also worked on debugging issues, optimizing SQL queries, and improving performance.

One challenge I faced was slow data loading, which I resolved by optimizing SQL queries and adding indexes, which improved performance significantly.”
