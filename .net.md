---

## ✅ **General .NET Core Questions**

### 1. **What is .NET Core and how is it different from .NET Framework?**

**Answer:**
.NET Core is a cross-platform, open-source version of the .NET Framework. Unlike .NET Framework, which runs only on Windows, .NET Core runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It supports microservices, containers, and cloud-based development.

---

### 2. **What are the key features of .NET Core?**

**Answer:**

* Cross-platform support
* Open-source
* Lightweight and high performance
* Dependency Injection built-in
* Unified MVC & Web API framework
* Modular and side-by-side deployment

---

### 3. **Advantages of .NET Core over .NET Framework**

**Answer:**

* Cross-platform support
* Better performance and scalability
* Improved CLI tools
* Support for microservices and containers (Docker)
* Lightweight and modular via NuGet

---

### 4. **What is the .NET Core CLI?**

**Answer:**
The .NET Core CLI is a command-line interface for building, running, and publishing .NET applications. Example:

```bash
dotnet new console
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

---

### 5. **How do you create a new .NET Core project using CLI?**

**Answer:**

```bash
dotnet new webapi -n MyApiProject
cd MyApiProject
dotnet run
```

---

## ✅ **ASP.NET Core (Web Development)**

### 1. **Difference between ASP.NET Core and ASP.NET MVC**

**Answer:**

* ASP.NET Core is cross-platform and open-source.
* It unifies MVC and Web API.
* Built-in support for DI, middleware, and cloud-based development.

---

### 2. **What is Middleware in ASP.NET Core?**

**Answer:**
Middleware are components in the request pipeline that handle requests/responses. They can:

* Handle exceptions
* Log requests
* Authenticate users
  Example: `app.UseRouting()`, `app.UseAuthentication()`

---

### 3. **Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core**

**Answer:**
DI is built-in. Register services in `Startup.cs` → `ConfigureServices()`:

```csharp
services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();
```

Inject into constructor:

```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly IMyService _service;
    public HomeController(IMyService service)
    {
        _service = service;
    }
}
```

---

### 4. **Role of `Startup.cs`**

**Answer:**

* `ConfigureServices` – register services and DI
* `Configure` – define middleware pipeline

---

### 5. **Types of Routing in ASP.NET Core**

**Answer:**

* **Conventional Routing** (e.g., `{controller=Home}/{action=Index}`)
* **Attribute Routing** (e.g., `[HttpGet("api/products/{id}")]`)

---

### 6. **Use of `appsettings.json`**

**Answer:**
Holds configuration data (e.g., connection strings, app settings).
Access via `IConfiguration`:

```csharp
var connection = Configuration["ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection"];
```

---

## ✅ **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**

### 1. **EF Core vs EF6**

**Answer:**

* EF Core is lightweight, cross-platform, and has better performance.
* Supports LINQ, NoSQL, and shadow properties.
* Some features like lazy loading require explicit configuration.

---

### 2. **Database Configuration in EF Core**

**Answer:**
Use `DbContext` options in `Startup.cs`:

```csharp
services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("Default")));
```

---

### 3. **Difference: `DbContext` vs `DbSet`**

**Answer:**

* `DbContext`: Bridge between database and domain models.
* `DbSet<T>`: Represents a table in the database.

---

### 4. **EF Core Migrations**

**Answer:**

* Create migration: `dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate`
* Update DB: `dotnet ef database update`

---

### 5. **Eager vs Lazy vs Explicit Loading**

**Answer:**

* **Eager**: Load related data immediately using `.Include()`
* **Lazy**: Loads when accessed (needs config)
* **Explicit**: Manually load with `.Entry().Collection().Load()`

---

## ✅ **API Development**

### 1. **Creating REST API**

**Answer:**
Use `[ApiController]`, routing, and actions returning data:

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult Get() => Ok(productService.GetAll());
}
```

---

### 2. **Use of `[ApiController]`**

**Answer:**

* Enables automatic model validation
* Automatic binding from body/query/form
* Improves error messages and status responses

---

### 3. **Model Binding & Validation**

**Answer:**
Model binding maps request data to C# objects. Use `[FromBody]`, `[FromQuery]`, etc.
Validation with Data Annotations:

```csharp
public class Product {
    [Required] public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

---

### 4. **Custom Status Codes**

**Answer:**

```csharp
return StatusCode(403, "Forbidden");
return NotFound("Item not found");
return Ok(data);
```

---

### 5. **API Security**

**Answer:**

* Use JWT tokens
* Configure middleware with `AddAuthentication()`, `AddJwtBearer()`
* Protect endpoints with `[Authorize]`

---

## ✅ **Authentication & Authorization**

### 1. **Authentication in ASP.NET Core**

**Answer:**
Configured in `Startup.cs` using middleware. Can use cookie, JWT, or third-party providers (Google, Microsoft).

---

### 2. **Claims vs Role-based Authorization**

**Answer:**

* **Role-based**: `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]`
* **Claims-based**: `[Authorize(Policy = "RequireEmployeeClaim")]`

---

### 3. **JWT Authentication**

**Answer:**
Use `AddAuthentication().AddJwtBearer()`, issue tokens on login, and secure APIs with `[Authorize]`.

---

### 4. **Policy-based Authorization**

**Answer:**
Define custom policies:

```csharp
services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("AdminOnly", policy =>
        policy.RequireRole("Admin"));
});
```

---

## ✅ **Advanced Topics**

### 1. **Kestrel Server**

**Answer:**
Kestrel is the default cross-platform web server in .NET Core. Lightweight and fast. Can be used standalone or with IIS/Nginx.

---

### 2. **`IHostedService` & `BackgroundService`**

**Answer:**
Used for long-running background tasks:

```csharp
public class MyBackgroundService : BackgroundService
{
    protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
    {
        while (!stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            // logic here
            await Task.Delay(1000);
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 3. **Configuration in .NET Core**

**Answer:**
Handled via `appsettings.json`, environment variables, or secrets. Read with `IConfiguration`.

---

### 4. **DI Lifetimes: Transient vs Scoped vs Singleton**

* **Transient**: New instance every time.
* **Scoped**: One per request.
* **Singleton**: Single instance for the app lifetime.

---

### 5. **Filters in ASP.NET Core**

**Answer:**
Used to run code before/after controller actions.
Types:

* Authorization
* Resource
* Action
* Exception
* Result

---

## ✅ **Practical/Coding-Based**

### 1. **Global Exception Handling**

**Answer:**
Use `UseExceptionHandler` or custom middleware:

```csharp
app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
```

---

### 2. **SMTP Email Service**

```csharp
public async Task SendEmailAsync(string to, string subject, string body)
{
    var client = new SmtpClient("smtp.example.com")
    {
        Port = 587,
        Credentials = new NetworkCredential("user", "pass"),
        EnableSsl = true
    };
    await client.SendMailAsync(new MailMessage("from@example.com", to, subject, body));
}
```

---

### 3. **Custom Middleware**

```csharp
public class LoggingMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    public LoggingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next) => _next = next;
    
    public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Request: {context.Request.Path}");
        await _next(context);
    }
}
```

---

### 4. **Pagination in API**

```csharp
[HttpGet]
public IActionResult Get(int page = 1, int pageSize = 10)
{
    var paged = _db.Users.Skip((page - 1) * pageSize).Take(pageSize);
    return Ok(paged);
}
```
