### ✅ **What is Dependency Injection (DI)?**

**Dependency Injection** is a **design pattern** used in software development to achieve **loose coupling** between classes and their dependencies.

> ❝ In simple terms, **DI means**: Instead of creating an object (dependency) inside a class, we provide (inject) it from the outside. ❞

It is widely used in **ASP.NET Core**, where services are registered and injected automatically via the **built-in IoC container** (Inversion of Control).

---

### ✅ **Why Use Dependency Injection?**

* ✔️ Improves testability (easier to write unit tests)
* ✔️ Promotes loose coupling
* ✔️ Enhances code reusability and maintainability
* ✔️ Makes code easier to manage and extend

---

### ✅ **Types of Dependency Injection**

There are **three main types** of DI:

| Type                         | Description                                              | Example                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Constructor Injection** | Dependencies are provided through the class constructor. | ✅ Most commonly used in .NET Core            |
| **2. Property Injection**    | Dependencies are set through public properties.          | Rarely used                                  |
| **3. Method Injection**      | Dependencies are passed through method parameters.       | Useful when needed only in a specific method |

---

### 🔧 **Example: Constructor Injection (ASP.NET Core)**

```csharp
public interface IMessageService
{
    void Send(string message);
}

public class EmailService : IMessageService
{
    public void Send(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Email sent: {message}");
    }
}

public class NotificationController : Controller
{
    private readonly IMessageService _messageService;

    // Constructor Injection
    public NotificationController(IMessageService messageService)
    {
        _messageService = messageService;
    }

    public IActionResult Notify()
    {
        _messageService.Send("Hello from DI!");
        return Ok();
    }
}
```

### 🔧 **Registering in Startup.cs**

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddScoped<IMessageService, EmailService>();
}
```

---

### ✅ Summary

* **Dependency Injection** is a way to pass required objects to a class from outside, rather than creating them inside.
* It’s mainly done via **constructor injection** in .NET Core.
* It helps in building **modular, testable, and maintainable code**.
