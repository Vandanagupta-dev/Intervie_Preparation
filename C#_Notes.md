C# doesn’t have “named” class kinds in quite the same way as, say, Java (with interfaces vs. classes), but you can think of classes in C# as coming in several flavors based on modifiers, usage or how they’re declared:

---

## 1. Concrete (Regular) Class

```csharp
public class Person { … }
```

– You can instantiate it; it can have fields, methods, properties, etc.

---

## 2. Abstract Class

```csharp
public abstract class Animal  
{  
    public abstract void Speak();  
}
```

– Cannot be instantiated directly; provides base functionality/contracts.

---

## 3. Sealed Class

```csharp
public sealed class MathUtilities { … }
```

– Cannot be inherited from. Often used to prevent subclassing.

---

## 4. Static Class

```csharp
public static class Configuration  
{  
    public static string Read(string key) => …;  
}
```

– Only contains `static` members; you can’t instantiate it or inherit from it.

---

## 5. Partial Class

```csharp
// File1.cs
public partial class Order { void Save() { … } }
// File2.cs
public partial class Order { void Validate() { … } }
```

– Lets you split a single class’s definition across multiple files (often used by tools–e.g. WinForms, EF).

---

## 6. Nested (Inner) Class

```csharp
public class Outer  
{  
    public class Inner  
    {  
        // only accessible as Outer.Inner  
    }  
}
```

– A class defined inside another; great for logical grouping or implementing helpers.

---

## 7. Generic Class

```csharp
public class Repository<T>  
{  
    public void Add(T item) { … }  
}
```

– Parameterized by one or more type arguments at compile time.

---

## 8. Record Class (C# 9+)

```csharp
public record PersonRecord(string FirstName, string LastName);
```

– Immutable by default, value‑based equality, built‑in `ToString`, `with` expressions, etc.

---

## 9. Anonymous Types (Compiler‑Generated)

```csharp
var anon = new { Name = "Alice", Age = 30 };
```

– You don’t explicitly declare a class, but the compiler generates one at compile time.

---

### Accessibility Modifiers

Independently of the above, every class can also have an access modifier, which affects *where* it’s visible:

| Modifier                         | Visibility                                |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `public`                         | Anywhere                                  |
| `internal`                       | Only within same assembly                 |
| `private`                        | (Nested classes only) only within parent  |
| `protected`/`protected internal` | Only to subclasses (and/or same assembly) |

---

### Putting it all together

You can even combine these:

```csharp
internal static partial class Foo<T> { … }
```

Here `Foo<T>` is a static, generic, partial class only visible inside its own assembly.

---

**In summary**, the main “types” of classes in C# are:

1. **Concrete**
2. **Abstract**
3. **Sealed**
4. **Static**
5. **Partial**
6. **Nested**
7. **Generic**
8. **Record**
9. **Anonymous (compiler‑generated)**

…and each of those can carry the usual C# access modifiers (`public`, `internal`, etc.).

**Here are some common C# interview questions along with concise answers to help you prepare:

---

### 1. What’s the difference between **`abstract`** classes and **interfaces** in C#?

* **Abstract class**

  * Can contain both abstract methods (no body) and concrete methods (with implementation).
  * Can define fields, constructors, and access modifiers.
  * A class can inherit only one abstract base.

* **Interface**

  * (Pre‑C# 8) Can contain only method/property/event signatures (no bodies). Since C# 8 default implementations are allowed.
  * Cannot contain fields or constructors.
  * A class or struct can implement multiple interfaces.

---

### 2. Explain **`async`/`await`**. How does it differ from traditional threading?

* Mark a method with `async` and return `Task`/`Task<T>` so callers can await it.
* `await` yields control back to the caller until the awaited `Task` completes—**without** blocking the thread.
* Under the hood, the compiler rewrites it as a state machine.
* **Difference**: Threads actually block/wait, whereas async methods free up the thread to do other work (better scalability in I/O‑bound scenarios).

  Normally जब हम कोई time-taking operation (जैसे DB call, file read, API call) run करते हैं तो वो main thread को block कर देता है।
इससे UI hang होने लगता है और responsiveness कम हो जाती है।
🔹 2. async / await क्या है?

async → बताता है कि function asynchronous होगा।

await → बताता है कि यहाँ रुकना है जब तक task complete न हो जाए, लेकिन main thread block नहीं होगा।

इससे UI smooth चलता है और heavy operations background में होते हैं।
---

### 3. What are **delegates**, and how do they differ from **events**?

* **Delegate**

  * A type‑safe function pointer: `public delegate int Transformer(int x);`
  * Can be invoked directly.

* **Event**

  * A special delegate field with publisher/subscriber semantics:

    ```csharp
    public event EventHandler Clicked;
    ```
  * Only the declaring class can invoke (raise) it; subscribers can only add/remove handlers.

---

### 4. How do **boxing** and **unboxing** work?

* **Boxing**

  * Converting a value type (e.g. `int`) into `object` or an interface it implements.
  * Wraps the value in a heap‑allocated object.

* **Unboxing**

  * Converting back from `object` to a value type.
  * Requires an explicit cast and will throw if the runtime type doesn’t match.

---

### 5. Explain **generics** in C#. Why use them?

* Generics let you write type‑safe, reusable code:

  ```csharp
  public class Repository<T> { … }
  ```
* Benefits:

  * **Type safety** (no need to cast).
  * **Performance** (avoids boxing and reflection).
  * **Reusability** (one implementation works for many types).

---

### 6. What’s the difference between **`IEnumerable<T>`** and **`IQueryable<T>`**?

* **`IEnumerable<T>`**

  * In‑memory, forward‑only iteration. Methods (e.g. `.Where`, `.Select`) operate in .NET after data is loaded.

* **`IQueryable<T>`**

  * Extends `IEnumerable<T>` with an expression tree.
  * Query provider (e.g. Entity Framework) can translate operations into SQL (deferred execution on the database side).

---

### 7. What is **dependency injection** (DI) and how does .NET Core support it?

* **DI**

  * Inversion of control pattern: dependencies are “injected” rather than created by the class itself.
  * Promotes testability, loose coupling, and easier maintenance.

* **.NET Core**

  * Built‑in container via `IServiceCollection` in `Startup.cs`:

    ```csharp
    services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
    services.AddScoped<IOther, OtherImpl>();
    services.AddSingleton<ILogger, Logger>();
    ```

---

### 8. What’s the **difference** between **`StringBuilder`** and **`string`** concatenation?

* **`string`**

  * Immutable: each concatenation creates a new string and copies data—bad for many repeated concatenations.

* **`StringBuilder`**

  * Mutable buffer: efficient when building up large or dynamic text via multiple `.Append()` calls.

---

### 9. How do you handle **exceptions** in C#? Any best practices?

* Use `try { … } catch (SpecificException ex) { … } finally { … }`.
* **Best practices**:

  * Catch the most specific exceptions you can handle.
  * Don’t swallow exceptions silently—log or rethrow.
  * Use `using` or C# 8’s `using var` for `IDisposable` instead of manual `finally` cleanup.

---

### 10. What is the **GC** (Garbage Collector) and how does it work in .NET?

* A background service that **automatically reclaims** memory of objects no longer referenced.
* Generational: Gen 0 (short‑lived) → Gen 1 → Gen 2 (long‑lived, expensive to collect).
* Triggers when Gen 0 fills, large object heap allocs occur, or on explicit `GC.Collect()` (rarely recommended).

Sure! Here's a concise yet clear answer for each **.NET Core technical question** you asked, perfect for interviews:

---

### 1. **What is the difference between .NET Core and .NET Framework?**

* **.NET Framework** is Windows-only, mature, and used mainly for desktop and ASP.NET applications.
* **.NET Core** is cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS), lightweight, open-source, and designed for modern cloud and web apps.
* .NET Core supports modular architecture and side-by-side versioning, unlike .NET Framework.

---

### 2. **What is dependency injection? How is it implemented in .NET Core?**

* Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern to inject dependencies into classes rather than creating them internally, promoting loose coupling and easier testing.
* In .NET Core, DI is built-in. You register services in the `Startup.cs` file’s `ConfigureServices` method using methods like `services.AddSingleton()`, `services.AddScoped()`, or `services.AddTransient()`. These services are then injected into constructors.

---

### 3. **What is middleware in ASP.NET Core?**

* Middleware are components in the HTTP request pipeline that handle requests and responses.
* Each middleware can perform actions before and after the next middleware executes.
* Examples: Authentication, routing, error handling middleware. Middleware is configured in `Startup.cs` via the `Configure` method using `app.Use...()` methods.

---

### 4. **How is routing handled in ASP.NET Core MVC?**

* Routing maps URLs to controller actions.
* ASP.NET Core supports **conventional routing** (defined patterns like `{controller}/{action}/{id?}`) and **attribute routing** (using attributes like `[Route("api/[controller]")]` on controllers or actions).
* Routing is configured in `Startup.cs` inside the `Configure` method.

---

### 5. **What is Entity Framework Core and how does it work?**

* EF Core is an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that enables developers to work with databases using .NET objects instead of SQL queries.
* It maps your classes (entities) to database tables and allows querying/updating data using LINQ.
* It supports migrations to evolve the database schema as your models change.

---

### 6. **What is the difference between eager, lazy, and explicit loading in EF Core?**

* **Eager Loading**: Loads related data along with the main entity in a single query using `.Include()`.
* **Lazy Loading**: Loads related data only when you access the navigation property. Requires enabling proxies.
* **Explicit Loading**: Manually loads related data by calling `.Load()` on the navigation property after the main entity is retrieved.

---

### 7. **How do you implement authentication and authorization in ASP.NET Core?**

* **Authentication** verifies user identity (e.g., cookie-based, JWT tokens, OAuth).
* **Authorization** controls access to resources based on roles, claims, or policies.
* Implemented using middleware, `[Authorize]` attribute, and configuring schemes in `Startup.cs`.

---

### 8. **What are the differences between ViewBag, ViewData, and TempData?**

* **ViewData**: A dictionary for passing data from controller to view; data lasts for a single request.
* **ViewBag**: A dynamic wrapper around ViewData, provides simpler syntax.
* **TempData**: Stores data that persists across redirects (multiple requests); usually implemented using session.

---

### 9. **What is model binding and validation in MVC?**

* **Model binding** automatically maps HTTP request data (form fields, query strings) to action method parameters or model properties.
* **Validation** uses data annotations (e.g., `[Required]`, `[Range]`) on models to enforce rules. The framework validates incoming data and sends validation errors to views.

---

### 10. **How do you handle exceptions globally in ASP.NET Core?**

* Use **middleware** like `app.UseExceptionHandler()` in `Startup.cs` to catch unhandled exceptions globally and show custom error pages or JSON responses.
* For API projects, you can use exception filters or custom middleware for structured error handling and logging.

Here’s a detailed explanation of **all common HTTP request methods**, their use cases, and behavior:

---

## 🔑 **HTTP Request Methods Overview**

HTTP methods define the **action** to be performed on a given resource. They are part of the HTTP protocol used by web browsers, APIs, and servers.

---

### ✅ 1. **GET**

* **Purpose**: Retrieve data from a server (read-only).
* **Safe**: Yes
* **Idempotent**: Yes
* **Body Allowed**: No (though technically possible, usually ignored)
* **Use Case**: Fetch a list of users, get product details.

```http
GET /products/123 HTTP/1.1
```

---

### ✅ 2. **POST**

* **Purpose**: Submit data to the server (create resource).
* **Safe**: No
* **Idempotent**: No
* **Body Allowed**: Yes
* **Use Case**: Register a new user, add a comment.

```http
POST /users HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

---

### ✅ 3. **PUT**

* **Purpose**: Update/replace a resource entirely.
* **Safe**: No
* **Idempotent**: Yes
* **Body Allowed**: Yes
* **Use Case**: Update a user’s full profile.

```http
PUT /users/123 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Updated",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

---

### ✅ 4. **PATCH**

* **Purpose**: Partially update a resource.
* **Safe**: No
* **Idempotent**: Yes (but depends on implementation)
* **Body Allowed**: Yes
* **Use Case**: Update just the user's email.

```http
PATCH /users/123 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "new@example.com"
}
```

---

### ✅ 5. **DELETE**

* **Purpose**: Delete a resource.
* **Safe**: No
* **Idempotent**: Yes
* **Body Allowed**: Sometimes (but often ignored)
* **Use Case**: Delete a product, user, or post.

```http
DELETE /posts/456 HTTP/1.1
```

---

### ✅ 6. **HEAD**

* **Purpose**: Like GET, but retrieves only the **headers**, no body.
* **Safe**: Yes
* **Idempotent**: Yes
* **Use Case**: Check if a resource exists, get metadata, test links.

```http
HEAD /file.zip HTTP/1.1
```

---

### ✅ 7. **OPTIONS**

* **Purpose**: Describe the communication options for the target resource (CORS preflight checks).
* **Safe**: Yes
* **Idempotent**: Yes
* **Use Case**: Ask the server what methods are allowed.

```http
OPTIONS /users HTTP/1.1
```

---

### ✅ 8. **CONNECT**

* **Purpose**: Establish a tunnel to the server (used for HTTPS via proxy).
* **Use Case**: Used mainly with proxies to set up SSL tunnels.

```http
CONNECT www.example.com:443 HTTP/1.1
```

---

### ✅ 9. **TRACE**

* **Purpose**: Echo the received request for debugging.
* **Use Case**: Diagnostic method (often disabled for security reasons).

```http
TRACE /some-path HTTP/1.1
```

---

## 🔁 Idempotent vs Safe

| Method  | Safe | Idempotent  | Notes                         |
| ------- | ---- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| GET     | ✅    | ✅           | Reading only                  |
| HEAD    | ✅    | ✅           | Like GET but no body          |
| OPTIONS | ✅    | ✅           | Used for communication checks |
| POST    | ❌    | ❌           | Not safe, not idempotent      |
| PUT     | ❌    | ✅           | Full update                   |
| PATCH   | ❌    | ✅ (partial) | Partial update                |
| DELETE  | ❌    | ✅           | Deletes resource              |
