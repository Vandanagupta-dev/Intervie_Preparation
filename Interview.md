Perfect 👍 So since it’s a **verbal technical round** (no machine test), they’ll mainly check your **conceptual clarity** and **real-world understanding** instead of deep coding syntax.

Let’s break it down by topic type 👇

---

### 🧠 1. **Core Technical Questions (Concept-based)**

If you’re from a .NET / C# background (which I know you are 😉), expect questions like:

* What is the difference between **value types** and **reference types** in C#?
* Explain **abstract class vs interface**.
* What is **dependency injection** and why do we use it?
* What’s the difference between **IEnumerable**, **IQueryable**, and **List**?
* Explain **asynchronous programming** (`async` / `await`) in simple terms.
* What are **delegates** and **events** in C#?
* What’s the purpose of **ViewModel** in ASP.NET MVC / Core?
* How does **middleware** work in ASP.NET Core?

---

### 🧩 2. **Project-Related Discussion**

They’ll probably ask about your recent or current project:

* What’s your **role** in the project?
* Which **architecture or pattern** are you using (e.g., Repository, MVC)?
* How do you handle **database operations** (ADO.NET / EF Core / Stored Procedures)?
* How do you handle **errors / logging**?
* How do you implement **authentication & authorization** (cookies, roles, JWT, etc.)?
* How do you manage **performance** or **pagination** in large data grids?

Tip 💡: Try to explain with short real examples — e.g.

> “In my last project, I implemented cookie-based authentication using ClaimsPrincipal and handled role-based access for Admin and User.”

### 🧾 3. **SQL & Database Questions**

* Difference between **INNER JOIN** and **LEFT JOIN**
* What is a **stored procedure** and when to use it?
* How do you **optimize a query**?
* What’s the difference between **DELETE**, **TRUNCATE**, and **DROP**?
* How do you find **duplicate records** in a table?

---

### ⚙️ 4. **Scenario / Problem-Solving Questions**

They might give a situation and ask how you’ll handle it:

* “If a user’s subscription expires, how will you manage the renewal process?”
* “If the system slows down while fetching user list, what can you do?”
* “If you get an exception from SQL while inserting, what will you check first?”

---

### 💬 5. **Communication Tip**

Since it’s **verbal**, focus on:

* Explaining logic **step-by-step**, not just the final answer.
* Avoid long pauses — think aloud if needed.
* If you forget a term, explain in your own words; they care more about understanding than jargon.

Would you like me to prepare a **mock verbal round** for you — like an HR-style simulated interview where I ask 8–10 realistic questions one by one (and you answer verbally or by typing)?
That’ll help you **practice the same format** you’ll face on Saturday.
