❓"Why do you want to switch your company?"
(Or: "Why are you leaving your current job?" etc.)
✅ Answer (Hindi-English Mix – Interview Friendly):
"Maine apne current company Supertek Software Solutions mein kaafi kuch seekha — especially .NET MVC, .NET Core, aur Entity Framework jaise technologies pe kaam karne ka mauka mila.

Lekin ab main apne aapko next level pe le jaana chahti hoon — jahan mujhe naye challenges milein, naye projects pe kaam karne ka exposure ho, aur main aur grow kar sakun professionally.

Chandigarh ki aapki company mujhe ek aisa hi platform lagti hai jahan main apne existing skills ka use kar sakti hoon, aur naye tools aur technologies bhi seekh sakti hoon."

✅ Optional: Pure English Version (if interview is fully in English):
"I’ve learned a lot in my current company, especially working with .NET MVC, Core, and Entity Framework. But now I’m looking for new challenges and opportunities that allow me to grow further in my career.
I believe your company in Chandigarh offers the kind of projects and learning environment I’m aiming for."
