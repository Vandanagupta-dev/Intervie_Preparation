Hello, my name is Vandana. Iâ€™m from Kushinagar district. I completed my schooling from UP Board with over 84%, and later pursued a diploma in 2023, securing 83%.

During my college placement, I got an internship opportunity at Techpile Technology Pvt. Ltd., where I gained hands-on experience in frontend, backend, and database development. My core technology is .NET.
